NOTES:
For simple programs, CPAchecker ran much faster compared to KLEE. For more complex tests such as binary search, 
CPAchecker ended up performing slightly worse. There are two special cases to make note of. In the regex_recusion
test case, the 4.0 seconds is not really accurate since it ignores all recursive calls. For the while_var test,
KLEE was left running for 10 minutes and never finished, so total time is not known.
