NOTES:
The test cases binary_search_correct, get_sign, sort, and while_const do not throw any exceptions,
meaning there are none to be found.

For test case binary_search_incorrect, both KLEE and CPAchecker found the same problem, but KLEE 
was able to show every possibility in only 4 examples, where CPAchecker needed 19. In the 
regex_recursion test, CPAchecker was not able to find  any examples that lead to an assertion. 
For the while_var test case, CPAchecker was able to create one execution path leading to the 
assertion. Although KLEE never finished, it calculated over 800 execution paths in the 10 minutes 
it was running.
