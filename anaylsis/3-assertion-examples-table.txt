NOTES:
All cases with 0 did not have any assertions. For test case binary_search_incorrect, both KLEE
and CPAchecker found the same problem, but KLEE was able to show every possibility in only 4
examples, where CPAchecker needed 19. In the regex_recursion test, CPAchecker was not able to find 
any examples that lead to an assertion. For the while_var test case, CPAchecker was able to create 
one execution path leading to the assertion. Although KLEE never finished, it calculated over 800
execution paths in the 10 minutes it was running.
